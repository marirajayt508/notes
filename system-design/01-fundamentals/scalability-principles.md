## What is Scalability?

**Scalability** is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources to the system. It's about maintaining performance as the system grows.

### Key Concepts:
- **Load**: Number of users, requests, data volume
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, availability
- **Resources**: CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth

### Scalability vs Performance:
- **Performance**: How fast a system processes a single request
- **Scalability**: How well performance is maintained as load increases

## Types of Scalability

### 1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
Adding more power to existing machines.

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- No application changes needed
- Strong consistency (single machine)

**Cons:**
- Hardware limits (finite ceiling)
- Single point of failure
- Expensive at high levels
- Downtime during upgrades

**Example:**
```
Before: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM
After:  16 CPU cores, 64GB RAM
```

**Use Cases:**
- Legacy applications
- Applications requiring strong consistency
- Small to medium scale systems

### 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
Adding more machines to the pool of resources.

**Pros:**
- Nearly unlimited scaling potential
- Better fault tolerance
- Cost-effective with commodity hardware
- Can scale incrementally

**Cons:**
- Application complexity increases
- Data consistency challenges
- Network latency between nodes
- Load balancing required

**Example:**
```
Before: 1 server handling 1000 RPS
After:  10 servers each handling 100 RPS
```

**Use Cases:**
- Web applications
- Microservices
- Big data processing
- High-traffic systems

## Scalability Patterns

### 1. Load Distribution
```
Client Request → Load Balancer → [Server1, Server2, Server3, ...]
```

### 2. Data Partitioning (Sharding)
```
Users A-H → Shard 1
Users I-P → Shard 2  
Users Q-Z → Shard 3
```

### 3. Caching Layers
```
Client → CDN → Load Balancer → App Server → Cache → Database
```

### 4. Asynchronous Processing
```
Web Server → Message Queue → Background Workers
```

### 5. Database Replication
```
Write Requests → Master DB
Read Requests → [Slave1, Slave2, Slave3]
```

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Latency
Time to process a single request.
- **Target**: < 100ms for web applications
- **Measurement**: 95th percentile response time

### 2. Throughput
Number of requests processed per unit time.
- **Measurement**: Requests per second (RPS)
- **Target**: Depends on business requirements

### 3. Availability
Percentage of time system is operational.
- **99.9% (8.77 hours downtime/year)**
- **99.99% (52.6 minutes downtime/year)**
- **99.999% (5.26 minutes downtime/year)**

### 4. Consistency
All nodes see the same data simultaneously.
- **Strong Consistency**: All reads receive most recent write
- **Eventual Consistency**: System will become consistent over time
- **Weak Consistency**: No guarantees when all nodes will be consistent

**Solutions:**
- CDN implementation
- Data compression
- Geographic distribution
- Protocol optimization

### 4. Storage Bottlenecks
**Symptoms:**
- High disk I/O wait times
- Storage capacity limits
- Slow read/write operations

**Solutions:**
- SSD storage
- Distributed file systems
- Data archiving
- Storage optimization

## Scalability Design Principles

### 1. Stateless Design
- No server-side session state
- All state in database or cache
- Enables easy horizontal scaling

```python
# Bad: Stateful
class UserSession:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_data = {}  # Stored in memory
    
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.user_data.get(user_id)

# Good: Stateless
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, cache):
        self.cache = cache
    
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.cache.get(f"user:{user_id}")
```

### 2. Loose Coupling
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- Changes in one service don't affect others
- Enables independent scaling

### 3. Asynchronous Processing
- Non-blocking operations
- Message queues for background tasks
- Better resource utilization

### 4. Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Multiple cache levels (browser, CDN, application, database)
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Capacity Planning

### 1. Estimate Load
```
Daily Active Users: 1M
Average requests per user per day: 100
Peak traffic multiplier: 3x
Average RPS = (1M × 100) / (24 × 3600) = 1,157 RPS
Peak RPS = 1,157 × 3 = 3,471 RPS
```

### 2. Resource Requirements
```
Assuming each request needs:
- 10ms CPU time
- 50MB memory
- 1KB network bandwidth

For 3,471 RPS:
- CPU: 3,471 × 10ms = 34.71 CPU cores
- Memory: 3,471 × 50MB = 173GB
- Network: 3,471 × 1KB = 3.47 MB/s
```

### 3. Growth Planning
- Plan for 2-3x current capacity
- Monitor growth trends
- Automate scaling decisions
